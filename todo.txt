SF1 checkbox
make outer hex shrink based on performance
add AX-CPT to fortress?
EEG friendly (GameEventList -> TCP/IP)
set the n of the n-back for the bonuses
!constant # of bonus opportunities for each S
actually type symbol that was n-back ago? say yes or no for it, with possible penalty
better reward for finer-grained control
mines - both IFF and non-IFF for MOT - just have some be a particular color
paramaterizable standard deviation and range for mine movement
mines bounce off each other?

ToDo
----------
5. Better logging / EEG events
6. EEG Friendly / SSVEP
7. Consistent bonuses
8. Flight score based on inner hex distance
9. MOT (IFF and No-IFF versions)
10. MOT motion
10a. border reflections vs warping
10b. straight trajectory vs. random direction changes
       To make random motion every N-ms add to the direction a value
sampled from a normal distribution with a mean of 0. The larger the
stdev, the more random the motion.
       To make smooth direction changes cap the range of possible
directions and make more frequent smaller changes.
       Can also change make N random...
10c. occlusion or bouncing
13. Set N-back value for bonus symbols


Maybe
-----------
11. Expanding inner hex
12. Vary both inner and outer hex over course of game
14. Continuous n-back (same-as... yes or no)

What if destroying the fortress at 11 (best possible) was worth 200
points, destroying the fortress at 12 worth 150 and >12 worth the
normal 100?
> No need to stop at 12. How about a continuous function down to about 50 points?
