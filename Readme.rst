History
=======
Space Fortress is a video game with a long and distinguished history in 
cognitive science research, and a summary of that history is necessary, as the 
interface, screen layout, and scoring have changed considerably over the years. 
Space Fortress, based off of a 1980 vector-based arcade game by Cinematronics 
called Star Castle, was developed by Mané and Donchin (1989) in the mid-1980’s 
as part of a large DARPA project to study different training methods on a task 
that required operating under heavy cognitive load. The goals of creating the 
game was to develop a task that was difficult (requiring many hours to become 
expert) and engaging enough that players would be motivated to continue 
practicing after many hours of play. The game was then distributed to an 
international consortium of researchers, each tasked with developing their own 
“learning strateg” (Donchin, 1989) to hasten players’ mastery of the game. 
Any method used outside of letting the players practice the game on their own 
was considered a learning strategy.
