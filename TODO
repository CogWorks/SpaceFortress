* Velocities seems different on different resolutions

* Center world on non wide-screen displays that are windowed

* Seems to miss some keypress events, noticable if hold down thrust/turn keys

* Fortress does not always make explosion sound when destroyed

* Convert all raw x,y settings in config to ratios of world dimentions or screen dimensions
